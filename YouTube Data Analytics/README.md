# YouTube Data Analysis Project README

## Project Overview

This project focuses on retrieving video-level details for videos published by a specific YouTube channel. The primary steps include collecting data from the YouTube API (v3) by generating an API key through Google Cloud Console, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the collected data, and finally, ingesting the data into a PostgreSQL database. The project culminates in creating a dashboard using Tableau for visualization and analysis.

## Getting Started

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. **API Key Generation**: Obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console to access the YouTube API v3.

2. **Data Collection**: Use the API key to pull channel statistics, obtain playlist IDs for channels, and retrieve video IDs. Detailed instructions can be found in the [Data Collection](#data-collection) section below.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform EDA and feature engineering on the collected data to gain insights and prepare it for further analysis.

4. **Data Ingestion into PostgreSQL**: Ingest the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy or your preferred method. See the [Data Ingestion into PostgreSQL](#data-ingestion-into-postgresql) section for guidance.

5. **Creating a Tableau Dashboard**: Connect Tableau to your PostgreSQL database and design the dashboard for visualizing the insights gained from the data. More details are available in the [Creating a Tableau Dashboard](#creating-a-tableau-dashboard) section.

## Data Collection

1. **YouTube API v3**: Utilize the YouTube API v3 with your API key to retrieve data. This will involve making API requests to get channel statistics, playlist IDs, and video IDs for the target channel.

2. **Data Retrieval Process**: Provide an outline or code snippets explaining how you retrieved the data from the YouTube API, including the endpoints used and any rate limiting considerations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

1. **Data Exploration**: Describe the key insights gained from EDA, such as video trends, user engagement, and other interesting findings.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Discuss any new features or modifications made to the data for analysis, including any calculations, transformations, or aggregations.

## Data Ingestion into PostgreSQL

1. **Database Setup**: Detail the steps for setting up a PostgreSQL database, including creating tables for storing the YouTube data.

2. **Ingestion Process**: Explain how you ingested the cleaned data into PostgreSQL, whether through SQLAlchemy or other methods.

## Creating a Tableau Dashboard

1. **Tableau Connection**: Provide instructions on how to connect Tableau to your PostgreSQL database.

2. **Dashboard Design**: Describe the elements, visualizations, and insights presented in your Tableau dashboard. Share any Tableau-specific tips or tricks used.
