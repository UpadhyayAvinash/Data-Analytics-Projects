## Data Analysis Using SQL

### A. KPIâ€™s

1. Total Revenue:
`SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue 
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales];`
 
1. Average Order Value
`SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]`
 
1. Total Pizzas Sold
`SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold 
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]`
 
1. Total Orders
`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders 
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]`
 
1. Average Pizzas Per Order
`SELECT CAST(SUM(quantity)*1.0 --multiply with 1.0 to covert int data to float
/COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2))
AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales];`

### B. Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold
`SELECT DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) as order_hours, SUM(quantity) as total_pizzas_sold
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
group by DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
order by DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)`

### C. Weekly Trend for Orders
`SELECT 
    DATEPART(ISO_WEEK, order_date) AS WeekNumber,
    YEAR(order_date) AS Year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_orders
FROM 
    pizza_sales
GROUP BY 
    DATEPART(ISO_WEEK, order_date),
    YEAR(order_date)
ORDER BY 
    Year, WeekNumber;`

### D. % of Sales by Pizza Category
`SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) 
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_category`

### E. % of Sales by Pizza Size
`SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) as total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY pizza_size`

### F. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
`SELECT pizza_category, SUM(quantity) as Total_Quantity_Sold
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2
GROUP BY pizza_category
ORDER BY Total_Quantity_Sold DESC`

### G. Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC`
 
### H. Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Revenue ASC`
 
### I. Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold DESC`

### J. Bottom 5 Pizzas by Quantity
`SELECT TOP 5 pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Pizza_Sold
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Pizza_Sold ASC`

### K. Top 5 Pizzas by Total Orders
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC`
 
### L. Borrom 5 Pizzas by Total Orders
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY Total_Orders ASC`
 
### NOTE
If you want to apply the pizza_category or pizza_size filters to the above queries you can use WHERE clause. Follow some of below examples
`SELECT Top 5 pizza_name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM [pizzaDB].[dbo].[pizza_sales]
